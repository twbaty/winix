Winix Project Charter
1. Purpose

Winix exists to provide a native, fast, and open-source Unix-like command environment for Windows — a system that brings the familiarity of GNU-style utilities and shell behavior without depending on compatibility layers like MSYS, MinGW, or WSL.

Winix will be:

Native: All binaries compiled for Windows using C and C++.

Lightweight: Self-contained and efficient, with no external runtime dependencies.

Consistent: Behaves predictably across Windows versions.

Extendable: Built on a modular architecture that allows others to add new utilities and capabilities easily.

Our goal is to build a first-class command-line environment that feels like Linux but runs natively in Windows, uniting the strengths of both ecosystems.

2. Vision

To create an open, maintainable, long-lived command platform that:

Offers developers a clean, reliable command-line experience.

Provides familiar Unix semantics on Windows.

Becomes a legitimate alternative to Git Bash and other emulation layers.

Lives on as a community project guided by transparent design principles.

In short:

“Winix — the Unix you wish Windows had built in.”

3. Guiding Principles

Compatibility without dependence:
GNU utilities define our behavioral baseline, not our codebase.

Native first:
Every component compiles and runs cleanly under Windows, with no MSYS or WSL translation.

Clarity over complexity:
Simple design, minimal dependencies, and readable code over cleverness.

Shared ownership, single direction:
Contributions are welcome — but must align with the unified vision of a native, modular, Unix-like shell.

Open by design:
Source under the MIT License, encouraging collaboration and adoption across organizations and platforms.

4. Governance

Core maintainers (initially you) will set roadmap, approve architectural decisions, and ensure project coherence.

Contributors may submit utilities, patches, or documentation under review.

Community proposals (new features, ports, or integration ideas) must go through a structured Request for Comment (RFC) process to maintain focus and direction.

Goal: open collaboration, not chaos.

5. Technical Direction
Layer	Language	Description
Core Utilities	C	Reimplement essential GNU-like tools natively for Windows.
Shell	C++	Interactive REPL handling parsing, execution, redirection, and environment.
Libraries	C	Shared argument parsing, I/O, and filesystem abstractions.
Packaging	CMake	Unified build and install system.

The system layout will follow a Unix-style directory structure rooted at C:\Winix:

/usr/bin    → core utilities
/usr/lib    → shared libraries
/etc        → configuration
/var        → logs, runtime data

6. Roadmap (High-Level)

Phase 1: Establish build system, compile 5–7 core utilities.
Phase 2: Develop Winix shell (C++).
Phase 3: Add 15–20 utilities, improve pipeline and redirection.
Phase 4: Package for public use and begin community onboarding.
Phase 5: Documentation, versioned releases, and contributor guide.

7. Long-Term Objective

To make Winix the standard open-source Unix-like environment for Windows — fully independent, transparent, and community-driven — capable of living on long after its founders.
