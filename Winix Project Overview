Winix Project Overview
Mission

Winix is an open-source initiative to build a native, fast, Unix-like command environment for Windows — delivering the familiarity and power of GNU utilities without relying on compatibility layers like MSYS, MinGW, or WSL.

Our mission is simple:

Bring the clarity and strength of Linux command-line tooling to Windows — natively, cleanly, and permanently.

Purpose & Direction

Winix aims to:

Provide a modular suite of native Windows command-line utilities written in C.

Deliver a modern C++ shell that behaves like Bash but integrates cleanly with Windows internals.

Maintain behavioral compatibility with GNU utilities where appropriate, while using completely independent, clean-room implementations.

Follow a Unix-style directory structure under C:\Winix:

/usr/bin  – core utilities  
/usr/lib  – shared libraries  
/etc      – configuration  
/var      – logs, runtime data


The end goal: a self-contained, first-class CLI ecosystem that feels like Unix but runs purely on Windows.

Guiding Principles

Native First: All binaries are compiled for Windows — no MSYS, no WSL.

Behavioral Parity, Not Code Parity: GNU defines the behavioral baseline, not the implementation.

Simplicity Over Cleverness: Readable, maintainable code is the goal.

Open Collaboration, Single Direction: Contributions are welcome — divergence is not.

Transparency & Longevity: Everything is open-source (MIT License) and designed to outlive its creators.

Governance & Collaboration

Core Team: Defines architecture, approves merges, and maintains project integrity.

Contributors: Submit code, tests, or documentation aligned with the unified roadmap.

RFC Model: Major feature changes or design shifts require an open proposal and discussion before approval.

All contributions must align with the project’s primary goal — a cohesive, native Unix-like experience for Windows users.

Initial Technical Direction
Layer	Language	Description
Core Utilities	C	Standalone executables mirroring essential GNU tools (ls, cp, mv, rm, cat, etc.)
Shell	C++	Interactive REPL with parsing, execution, redirection, and environment management
Shared Library	C	Common argument parsing, error handling, and I/O routines
Build System	CMake	Unified cross-platform build and packaging framework
Roadmap (Simplified)

Phase 1: Core utilities (echo, ls, pwd, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, cat).

Phase 2: Core shell prototype (REPL, execution, built-ins).

Phase 3: Pipes, redirection, and environment handling.

Phase 4: Packaging, documentation, and open contributor onboarding.

MIT License — fully open, allowing commercial and community use with attribution.

Winix belongs to everyone who builds it — but its direction remains unified.
